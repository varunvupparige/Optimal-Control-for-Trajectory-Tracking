# Optimal-Control-for-Trajectory-Tracking
Designed a control policy for a differential-drive robot (red triangle) to track a reference trajectory (cyan crosses) while avoiding two circular obstacles by solving a discounted infinite horizon stochastic optimal control using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach.
